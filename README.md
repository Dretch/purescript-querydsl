An unfinished experimental SQL query builder for Purescript, loosely based on Java's Querydsl (http://www.querydsl.com/).

The goal is to allow building SQL in a type-safe and composable way, ideally with comprehensible types signatures.

# Features
 - Various combinators for creating type-checked predicates for selects/deletes.
 - Column names and types checked for insertions.
